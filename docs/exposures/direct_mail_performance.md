Life has its targets for the direct mail metric. Use the buttons just above the title of the
dashboard in order to filter the report by Campaign, Tactic, Product or Reporting Group. (as
defined below). View all tabs to get an exhaustive overview of the direct mail program's
performance.

This dashboard shows Direct Mail results from campaigns run by AAA Life in 2021 and later. For each
calculation, there is a comparison of actual results and targets that AAA Life expected to hit, 
along with a progress bar showing how close to the target the actuals were. The documentation for
the underlying table that creates this dashboard can be found in the 
[Direct Mail Campaign Performance](#!/model/model.aaa_life_data_platform.gold_direct_mail_campaign_performance)
