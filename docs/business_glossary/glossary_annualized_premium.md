# Annualized Premium
Annualized Premium is the amount a customer would pay on a schedule, which would involve applicable collection fees or 
modal factors, such as the credit card processing fee. In contrast, an Annual Premium is the amount that a customer 
would pay if he/she paid one year upfront. Annual Premium is Annualized Premium without the collection fee.
