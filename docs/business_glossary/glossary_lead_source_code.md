# Lead Source Code
Three character code to help note colloquially a "source", "channel", or "referrer" of an
application.

Lead source codes were originally developed to track commission payments. Club partners receive a
higher commission on policies that originate from their marketing efforts (e.g. club emails,
warm transfer programs, links on their web page) than they do for policies that are originated
through AAA Life Insurance's marketing activities or organic (customer-initiated activities such
as non-paid search or directly navigating to aaalife.com).

From a technical standpoint, some Lead Source Codes are mapped to SIT Codes in Life Plus in a 
one-to-many relationship. More than one Lead Source Code can be mapped to a single SIT Code, but
a Lead Source code can only be mapped to one of the SIT Codes. All AAA Life business processed in
Life+ is associated with a Lead Source Code to help identify where the business generated from, 
such as Life Desk for field agent business, Direct Mail â€“ Excela, or the 
[DSU](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#DSU)
to name a few examples. Currently, Lead Source Codes that are associated with a SIT Code 
only represent [DSU](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#DSU)
business. 

Lead Source Codes can be grouped at a higher level which we call [response channel](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#response_channel),
i.e. Mail Response, SISU Response, DSU Response, Vanity URL Response, GIWL Online Response, 
ExpressTerm Online Response, Agent Response, and Unknown Response.
and a related, but very different term is [marketing channel](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#marketing_channel),
i.e. Direct Mail, and then DSU, OnlineGIWL, ExpressTerm, Agent are to be determined.
