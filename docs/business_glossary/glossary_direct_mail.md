# Direct Mail
A distribution channel by which a physical piece of unsolicited promotional material is sent 
directly to prospective and current customers via the United States Postal System. 
“Direct Mail” may also represent the data, processes, and technology that contribute to and 
enable the sending of the promotional materials to its intended destination.  Most of the 
recipients of direct mail materials are members of the AAA clubs.

NOTE: For AAA Life Insurance Company, direct mail is first and foremost a distribution channel 
and it is relied upon for the majority of AAAL's sales).  The tangible manifestation of direct 
mail is a physical piece of promotional material, which is a distinction compared to other 
marketing and distribution channels. Another key point is that it is direct to the prospect, 
meaning there is no agent or middleman to rely upon for the sale.  It seems that our vernacular 
does also expand the definition of the mail beyond the tangible object to include things and 
processes that contribute to the creation and delivery of the mail.
