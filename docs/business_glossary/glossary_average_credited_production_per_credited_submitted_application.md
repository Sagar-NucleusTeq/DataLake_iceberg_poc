# Average Credited Production per Credited Submitted Application

### Area of the Business
[DSU](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#DSU)

### Definition
See [Lead Cohort](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#lead_cohort_reports),
[Opportunity Cohort](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#opportunity_cohort_reports),
or [Calendar](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#calendar_reports)
for definitions of these terms used below. 

_Lead Cohort Definition_: 
Total submitted [production](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#production)
from policies that were a direct result of a lead created and processed within the given calendar
period divided by submitted applications that were a direct result of a lead created and 
processed within the given calendar period. Applications can be submitted as a result of more 
than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial credit for the application (the 
denominator can contain a decimal). Similarly, each agent will receive part of the production 
amount from the application.

_Opportunity Cohort Definition_: 
Total submitted [production](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#production)
from policies that were a direct result of an opportunity created and processed within the given 
calendar period divided by submitted applications that were a direct result of an opportunity 
created and processed within the given calendar period. Applications can be submitted as a 
result of more than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial credit for the
application (the denominator can contain a decimal). Similarly, each agent will receive part 
of the production amount from the application.

_Calendar Definition_: 
Total submitted [production](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#production)
in a given calendar period divided by submitted applications during the same calendar period. 
Applications can be submitted as a result of more 
than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial credit for the application (the 
denominator can contain a decimal). Similarly, each agent will receive part of the production 
amount from the application.
