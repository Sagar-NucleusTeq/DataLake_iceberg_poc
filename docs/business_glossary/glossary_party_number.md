# Party Number

### Area of the Business
All

### Definition
Party number is the unique identifier used by AAA Life's policy administration systems (PAS). 
Party number should be unique, i.e. one individual_key should be associated with one 
party_number. Similar to individual_keys, shifting occurs, and while no party number will be 
associated with two individuals, we may see one individual associated with two party numbers.

A party is equivalent to a client and is a person or business that has a name and other
attributes that uniquely define it, namely, a mailing address, and a specific interest or connection 
to the policy itâ€™s attached to. These are the people or businesses with whom we might need 
to interact with as the policy goes through its life cycle from new business to claim payout.
