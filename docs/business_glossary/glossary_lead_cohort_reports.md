# Lead Cohort Reports

### Area(s) of the Business
DSU

### Definition
These are built as a funnel report where all activity is based on the lead created date. Any 
activity further down in the funnel is counted only where the lead created date is counted. For 
example, a submitted application is only counted in the month and year where the lead is counted. 

NOTE: This is the way items are calculated when the phrase ‘by lead cohort’ is used.
