# AAA Membership Number
The AAA membership number is a key used by AAA National to identify a particular member. In
theory, membership number is a key that corresponds to one individual. 

Membership numbers are not static and can change over time. An individual may have a lapse in their
membership and have a new number assigned when they re-join. 

All policies do not necessarily have a membership number associated with them. This occurs
primarily for two reasons:
1. AAA Life admin systems did not record the number
2. The policy is a broadmarket (non-member) policy and a membership number does not exist 
   for the party
