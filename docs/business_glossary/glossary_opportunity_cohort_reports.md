# Opportunity Cohort Reports

### Area(s) of the Business
DSU

### Definition
These are built as a funnel report where all activity is based on the opportunity created date, 
and then any actions after that - submitted applications, submitted production, settled policies, 
and settled production - are only counted where the opportunity that the activity is associated 
with is counted.

NOTES: 
1. This is the way items are calculated when the phrase ‘by opportunity cohort’ is used. 
2. The opportunity created date should always be available for an application or policy since 
 a quote is necessary in order to submit an application.
