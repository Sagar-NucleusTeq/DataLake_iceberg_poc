# Production
“Are we meeting production goal this year?“

"We are thinking about a price increase. How does that affect our production?"

When discussing how our Direct Mail business is doing, we’ve often used the term "production," 
but what does it mean exactly, and how does it relate to the term 'premium'? This documentation 
attempts to define the term ‘Production’ for our organization to facilitate communication either
in a conversation or in reports relating to the Direct Mail Channel. 

### The Generalized Definition of Production, Annualized Premium, and Annual Premium
> Production is a percentage of the premium associated with a given policy. It is often used to 
> discuss the performance of our business. The higher the production value, the more sales dollars we earned. 
> Each year a production goal is set for each sales channel, so production is also used to measure 
> the success of each channel’s marketing strategies. 

`Production` is a percentage of the `annualized premium`, except for Annuity and Universal Life 
products. The percentage is predefined by the product. For example, the production of plan code 
G20R (Direct Mail GIWL) is 100% of the policy’s annualized premium, whereas plan code ULA20 is 
roughly 82% of the policy’s paid premium.

Not all premium is comparable, for example, $10,000 in annuity premium is not equivalent to $10,000 in life premium 
in terms of profitability or compensation. Production for those two premiums reflects that and enabled the comparison. 
We use Production as a proxy to facilitate the discussion of the performance of our business. 

### Channel-Specific Definition - Production in Direct Mail
>The production(in USD) of a policy is referring to its first-year annualized premium. 

In Direct Mail, the terms annualized premium and production are often used interchangeably in conversations. To put it more 
precisely, the production (in USD) of a policy is referring to its first-year annualized premium for Direct Mail 
products. The production of a campaign, or a product in a given campaign, of a company, etc., then, is the aggregated 
first-year annualized premium amount of a given dimension in the discussion. The same definition can also be applied in 
our reporting for the Direct Mail Channel. 

### Calculation of Premium and Production
The calculation of the Annualized Premium amount (in USD) of a given policy is based on its associated product. Typically, it involves the following components:

1. Premium Rate 
   - Determined by the Actuarial Team 
2. Face Amount 
3. Policy Fee
   - The fee is different depending on the product.  
   - For example, as of 2021, it is $36 for a Direct Mail - GIWL policy 
4. Collection Fee (Modal Factor) 
    - e.g., credit card process fee 
```
Annualized Premium = Premium Rate x Face Amount + Policy Fee + Collection Fee 

Annual Premium = Annualized Premium - Collection Fee
 
Production = k% x Annualized Premium, where k is a value predefined for each product by the business. 
The value k can be found in the product description manual. 
```
>Side note: Commission is a percentage of premium, not production. The percentage of commission and production on production should be quite close.
