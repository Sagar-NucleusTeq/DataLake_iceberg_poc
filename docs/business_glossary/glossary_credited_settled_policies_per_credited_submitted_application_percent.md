### Area of the Business
[DSU](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#DSU)

### Definition
_[Lead Cohort](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#lead_cohort_reports) Definition_: 
The ratio of settled policies that were a direct result of a lead 
created and processed within the given calendar period to submitted applications that were a 
direct result of a lead created and processed within the given calendar period. Policies can be 
settled by more than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial credit for the policy 
and the numerator can contain a decimal. Similarly, applications can be submitted as a result 
of more than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial credit for the application 
and the denominator can contain a decimal.

_[Opportunity Cohort](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#opportunity_cohort_reports) Definition_: 
The ratio of settled policies that were a direct result of an 
opportunity created and processed within the given calendar period to submitted applications 
that were a direct result of an opportunity created and processed within the given calendar 
period. Policies can be settled by more than one agent meaning that each agent will receive 
partial credit for the policy and the numerator can contain a decimal. Similarly, applications 
can be submitted as a result of more than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial 
credit for the application and the denominator can contain a decimal.

_[Calendar](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#calendar_reports) Definition_: 
The ratio of settled policies entered during a given calendar period to 
submitted applications entered during the same calendar period. Policies can be settled by more 
than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial credit for the policy and the 
numerator can contain a decimal. Similarly, applications can be submitted as a result of more 
than one agent meaning that each agent will receive partial credit for the application and the 
denominator can contain a decimal.

### Calculation
`SUM(settled_policies)/SUM(submitted_applications)`
