# Direct Mail Completion Factors
Completion factors are estimates for the percentage of application submissions, settled policies, and production dollars
that we expect to receive on each day following a [direct mail](#!/exposure/docs.business_glossary.glossary#direct_mail) campaign mail drop date for one full calendar year, 
adjusted for leap years. They are calculated both individually and cumulatively for each day, and vary by product.

Direct Mail colleagues calculate completion factors when they prepare their annual sales estimates.
