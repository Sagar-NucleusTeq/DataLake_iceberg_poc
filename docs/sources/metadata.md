# Metadata
Metadata (AKA a set of data that describes and gives information about other data) that comes
from the [metadata](#!/source_list/metadata)
data system created & maintained by AAA Life. 

This specific set of metadata comes from the same source (the metadata manager) that is currently
used to execute Direct Mail and Email campaigns. It is expected to be used for more channels in
the future.

Some of the Metadata source tables' automation information is documented
[here](https://aaalife-data.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HAN/pages/11184799777/Data+Engineering+Automated+Tables+2021).
