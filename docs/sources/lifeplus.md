# LifePlus / Life +
Data coming from the LifePlus policy administration  system (PAS), also called AS400, also called
LifeSupportPlus. A life insurance PAS is a system that provides full end-to-end life cycle 
management of group and individual life and pension products. AAA Life currently has two 
PAS systems, AS400--the original PAS--and FAST, an updated system AAA Life intends to convert to.

LifePlus data enters the data platform through [this](https://aaalife-data.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HAN/pages/10676961297/Life+SCD+Pipeline)
process.

Many of the LifePlus source tables' automation information is documented
