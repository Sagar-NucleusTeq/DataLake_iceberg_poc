# Exclusions
The purpose of this table is for AEs to indicate policies that need to be excluded from the data platform altogether as 
a part of the [Temporary Global Policy Exclusion process](https://aaalife-data.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DPF/pages/11498160129/Temporary+Global+Policy+Exclusion). In brief, these are policies that fail key tests and therefore
cause the pipeline to fail due to data issues in the source system. This is intended as a temporary measure to allow 
production data refreshes and successful merge requests while the business resolves the issue. Currently, users update
the table manually.

Note: This source is not included in DSSE Maintained because the tables are in the `sandbox` schema.
