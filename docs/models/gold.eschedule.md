# eSchedule Campaigns

![last updated](assets/update_badges/staging_eservices_registrations.svg)

The data in this table comes from eSchedule. It contains information about digital marketing
campaigns and is used for tracking the campaign codes and URL creation process.

The campaign_code is a 10-character code to aid in tracking of digital campaigns; 
similar to the keycode in direct mail campaigns. All digital campaign codes should be found in the
eSchedule (PRDDM1.Digital.dbo.eSchedule).  Many of them are autogenerated from the
[Campaign Code Autogenerator](https://metadata.aaalife-data.com/campaign_code/)
