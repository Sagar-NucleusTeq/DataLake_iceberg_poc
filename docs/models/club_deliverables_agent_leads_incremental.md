# Club Agent Leads Incremental

![last updated](assets/update_badges/club_deliverables_agent_leads.svg)

This table contains a daily incremental load of the policies from 
[club_deliverables_agent_leads](#!/model/model.aaa_life_data_platform.club_deliverables_agent_leads).
The purpose of this table is to provide a history of all the leads we have ever generated for the clubs.
By storing this history we can develop reporting tracking the successfulness of these leads over time.

Each record contains policy information, insured information and product information. 
This table is generated by combining policy, insured and product information together and 
suppressing the policies whose policyholder requested not to be solicited with marketing outreach, 
for FAST and Lifeplus PAS systems separately. Then, the leads from two PAS systems are combined and 
categorized into different lead types to be sent to the clubs for sales follow up. 


There are 6 types of leads and the type of lead of a record is indicated by the corresponding 
indicator column:
- Lapse Leads (is_lapse_lead): Policyholders having lapsed or canceled 
Direct Mail Term that has expired in the past 90 days will be included in this lead list.
- Withdrawal Leads (is_withdrawal_lead): Policyholders having withdrawn 
Direct Mail Term that has expired in the past 90 days will be included in this lead list.
- 60 to 64 Anniversary Leads (is_60_to_64_anniversary_lead): Policyholders having a Direct Mail Term
product that needs renewal in 2 months and whose age at the renewal is between 60 and 64 will be 
included in this lead list.
- Less Than 60 Anniversary Leads (is_less_than_60_anniversary_lead): Policyholders having a Direct 
Mail Term product that needs renewal in 2 months and whose age at the renewal is between 35 and 60 
will be included in this lead list.
- Term Expiry Leads (is_term_expiry_lead): Policyholders having Term product that will expire in 2 
  months will be included in this lead list. 
- ULWL Annuity Anniversary Leads (is_ulwl_annuity_anniversary_lead): Policyholders
having products Universal Life, Annuity, Ordinary Whole Life, Ordinary SIWL, Juvenile Whole Life
and Juvenile SIWL that need renew in 2 months will be included in this lead list.
