# Direct Mail Campaign Status Club-State Tactic

![last updated](assets/update_badges/gold_direct_mail_campaign_status_clubstate_tactic.svg)

Summary table for reporting aggregate mail delivery metrics.  The data in this table is limited to 
campaigns for financial years 2021 and later. 

The decision to limit results to 2021 or later was made in May 2021 by Emily Heinlein due to
issues with incomplete or inaccurate information about Informed Delivery and Sales Plan for
campaigns prior to 2021.
