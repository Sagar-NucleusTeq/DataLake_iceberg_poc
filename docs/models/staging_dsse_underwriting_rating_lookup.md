# Underwriting Rating Lookup Table

![last updated](assets/update_badges/staging_dsse_underwriting_rating_lookup.svg)

Maps underwriting classifications for life insurance policies to descriptions and flags for
specific use cases. An underwriting rating identifies the mortality risk classification of
a particular policy. An individual with a baseline risk is referred to as "standard".
Individuals with lower than average mortality risk (healthier individuals) are referred to
as "preferred". Individuals with higher than average mortality risk are referred to
as "sub-standard".
