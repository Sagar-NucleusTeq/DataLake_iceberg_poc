# Direct Mail Sales Plan

![last updated](assets/update_badges/staging_dsse_sales_plan.svg)

The number of gross volume, net volume, cost, submitted applications,  
settled policies, and production dollars anticipated from any single  
campaign_year/campaign_number/reporting_group/club_code/state/tactic_name/product_name/ventile.
This table includes both sales plan and forecast, the primary difference being that forecast
uses some the actual data available to predict these metrics, while sales plan does not have
any actual data yet.
