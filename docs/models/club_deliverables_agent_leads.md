# Agent Leads

![last updated](assets/update_badges/club_deliverables_agent_leads.svg)

This table contains policies that will be used as sales leads for agents. Each record contains
policy information, insured information and product information. This table is generated by 
combining policy, insured and product information together and suppressing the policies whose 
policyholder requested not to be solicited with marketing outreach, for FAST and Lifeplus PAS 
systems separately. Then, the leads from two PAS systems are combined and categorized into
different lead types. 


There are 6 types of leads and the type of lead of a record is indicated by the corresponding 
indicator column:
- Lapse Leads (is_lapse_lead): Policyholders having lapsed or canceled 
Direct Mail Term that has expired in the past 90 days will be included in this lead list.

Direct Mail Term that has expired in the past 90 days will be included in this lead list.

product that needs renewal in 2 months and whose age at the renewal is between 60 and 64 will be

- Less Than 60 Anniversary Leads (is_less_than_60_anniversary_lead): Policyholders having a Direct 
Mail Term product that needs renewal in 2 months and whose age at the renewal is between 35 and 60
