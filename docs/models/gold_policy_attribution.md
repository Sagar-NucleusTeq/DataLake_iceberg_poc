# Policy Attribution

![last updated](assets/update_badges/gold_policy_attribution.svg)

Consumption table containing all levels of attribution information. 

Campaign attribution approach for 
direct mail campaign material represents what the business has defined
as last-touch attribution. However, there is a hierarchy to touches.
If an individual/household/address matches on finder number or phone 
number, this is the record attributed to, regardless if there was a
more recent mail. As such, it is not technically true last-touch.

Campaign attribution for all marketing channels except 
direct mail is currently marked as "TO_BE_DECIDED" until logic is 
incorporated.

Logic for attribution can be found here:
