# Multi Touch Attribution Step 1 Pre MDE Policies

![last updated](assets/update_badges/mid_attribution_direct_mail_step_1b_pre_mde_finder_number.svg)

Holding place for direct policies (from all response channels) that were applied for before
the first campaign launched from the MDE (4/19/2019) OR those known 
to belong to pre-MDE campaigns based on finder_numbers. If the leading 
character of the application id is a "K" and the response channel is not
SISU then it can reasonably be assumed marketing launched from the old platform. (SISU
still assigns finder numbers with a leading "K" character.) These
policies are not attributed to specific campaigns, rather they are identified
as pre-mde. For complete logic documentation please this confluence page:
