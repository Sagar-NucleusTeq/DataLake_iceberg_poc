# Policies for Multi Touch Attribution after 1

![last updated](assets/update_badges/mid_attribution_direct_mail_policies_for_attribution_after_1b.svg)

Table containing direct mail policies to be considered for marketing 
campaign attribution after step 1 is completed. (Step 1 captures 
policies with application id's beginning with a "K" that do not have
a SISU lead source codes, and those policies that have application dates
before the launch of the MDE.) Policies are only included in this table if 
they were not flagged in the previous run. These policies will be tested
for attribution in all other steps.

Logic for attribution can be found here:
[Attribution Requirements](https://aaalife-data.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2PA/pages/11282644993/2022+V3+Multi-Touch+Attribution+Requirements)

NOTE: This logic may/will need to be adjusted when touch sources outside of 
messages/promotion history are considered. Other sources (calls, lead lists, etc.)
can have dates previous to the MDE launch.
