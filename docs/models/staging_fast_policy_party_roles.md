# FAST Policy Party Roles

![last updated](assets/update_badges/staging_fast_policy_party_roles.svg)

This is the FAST party role master. It is the key piece of the whole policy-party 
structure. It tells us which party has a role in which policy, as well as what type of 
role it is. This specific table only spells out the connections between policy, party,
and membership, it doesn't contain any other info about the parties. 

A FAST party is a person or business that has a name and other attributes that uniquely 
define it, like a mailing address and a specific interest or connection 
to the policy itâ€™s attached to. These are the people or businesses with whom we might need 
to interact with as the policy goes through its life cycle from new business to claim payout.

NOTE: Policies that need to be temporarily filtered from the data platform via the [Temporary Global Policy Exclusion 
process](https://aaalife-data.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DPF/pages/11498160129/Temporary+Global+Policy+Exclusion) are filtered here.
