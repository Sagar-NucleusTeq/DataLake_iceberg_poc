# Class of Mail

Ingested from United States Postal Service (USPS) Service Type Identifiers (STID) reference
tables. The Postal Service divides mail into different services, called "classes." Each
class of mail has different features, service levels, postage prices, and presort
requirements.[1]

| Example Values |
|:--------------:|
| Ballot Returns |
| First-Class Mail  |
| Periodicals |
| USPS Marketing Mail |

Future: link to the correct document on Confluence, once folks decide which that should be.
