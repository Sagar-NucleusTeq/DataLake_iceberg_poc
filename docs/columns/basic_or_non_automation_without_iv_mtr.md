# Basic or Non-Automation Without IV-MTR
Ingested from United States Postal Service (USPS) reference tables for Service Type Identifiers (STID),
which are a component of the Intelligent Mail Barcodes (IMb).[1] This field contains STIDs for mail
pieces that are tracked via basic or no automation, and DO NOT use Informed Visibility Mail Tracking & 
Reporting (IV-MTR).

**Levels of Automation**
Mail can have no automation, basic automation, or full service automation.[2]
* No automation: mail does not have IMb
* Basic automation: mail has IMb and tracking is available. For an additional cost, the sender can 
also choose to receive Address Change Service (ACS) notifications. This means that senders will be
notified if mail was unable to be delivered due to address changes.[3]
* Full service automation: mail has IMb and additional tracking is available compared to the basic
automation service. Also, senders will automatically receive ACS notifications at no additional
charge.[3],[4]
