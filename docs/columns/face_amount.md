# Face Amount
The original amount of insurance purchased. AAA Life offers several set face amounts for each
product, commissions will sometimes vary according to face amount, and premiums definitely vary
by face amount - a higher face amount likely means a higher payout on death, which costs more in
premium.

NOTE: *Death Benefit* is what is paid out to beneficiaries but it can be different from 
*Face Amount* for several reasons including:  
1. Any loans on the policy reduce the Death Benefit
2. Option B in Universal Life (Death benefit = Face Amount + Cash Value - Outstanding Loans)  
3. Accelerated Death Benefits previously paid on the policy reduce the Death Benefit.

Changes to the Face Amount do occur but for many policy types they are only allowed before the
policy is in force (only during the application phase). For some flexible policies, like
Universal Life, the Face Amount may be changed after issue with additional underwriting.
