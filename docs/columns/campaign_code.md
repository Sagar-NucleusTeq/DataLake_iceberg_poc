# Campaign Code
Listed campaign code on policy application. If application scanned by
Exela, then this campaign code will correspond to campaign code for 
the package received. However, these are often nonsensical when entered
by hand.

"Keycode" in the FAST attributes table should be interpreted as campaign
code as it comes in at time of application not from promotion_history.

# Digital Campaign Code
10-character code to aid in tracking of digital campaigns; similar to the keycode
in direct mail campaigns. All digital campaign codes should be found in the
eSchedule (PRDDM1.Digital.dbo.eSchedule).  Many of them are autogenerated from
the
[Campaign Code Autogenerator](https://metadata.aaalife-data.com/campaign_code/)
