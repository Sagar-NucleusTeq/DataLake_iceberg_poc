| Universal Life         | Universal Life products are a combination between a Life product and a Investment (Annuity) product.  The policy holder pays regular premiums to indemnify against death. Premiums in excess of the amount required to cover for mortality are invested at a  floating rate depending on the prevailing interest rate  or other market conditions (subject to minimum).  The excess premiums grow in value over time and build "cash value". Cash value can be used to pay future premiums, can be withdrawn,  or a loan can be taken against it.   As of 2020, all new Universal Life products are sold through a third party agreement with Securian. |
