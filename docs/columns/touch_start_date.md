# Touch Start Date

For Mail: First date that any communication within said touch is sent to consumer. The date on which mail
is expected to be sent.  Also known as the campaign drop date or the target send date. This is the date used
for direct mail attribution (both last touch and multi).

For Email: First date the touch/creative is created. However, an individual can receive that creative 
any date after the original start date so it should not be interpreted as the drop date for email.
