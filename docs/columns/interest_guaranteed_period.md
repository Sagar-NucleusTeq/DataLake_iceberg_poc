# Interest Guaranteed Period

The time in years for which credited interest rates are guaranteed.

What is the credited interest rate?  Some life insurance plans are 
designed to be held long term. Through the credited interest rate 
declaration, the policy owners participate in the financial performance 
of the life insurance plan, whose performance is determined by the declared
credited interest rate.
