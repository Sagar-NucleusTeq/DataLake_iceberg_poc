# Number of months between a replaced policy's termination date and a new policy's application entry date

This field was developed to facilitate reporting on replacement policies. It is calculated as:
{replaced policy's termination date} - {new policy's application entry date}. Please note that:
* Values > 0 indicate that the replaced policy's termination date occurred **after** the new policy's application entry
date; and
* Values < 0 indicate that the replaced policy's termination date occurred **prior** to the new policy's application 
entry date.
