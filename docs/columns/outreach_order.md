# Outreach Order

Ranked order of the marketing messages attributed to a policy. The most recent
message is denoted as -1 with the most distant message as -n. Messages sent on the
same date are given tied ranks. For example: If one mail and one email message were
sent on 4/6/2022 and one message was sent on 3/6/2022, the messages sent on 4/6/2022
would both be given a rank of -1 with the message sent on 3/6/2022 given a rank of -3.
