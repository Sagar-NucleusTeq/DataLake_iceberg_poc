# Cost - Aggregate Sales Plan
The operational costs associated with achieving the projected outcomes 
in the record. These outcomes are:
* Number of submitted policies;
* Number of settled policies;
* Submitted production; and
* Settled production.

Since these costs reflect the grain of the table, they should be
interpreted by:
* Event month;
* Event year;
* Product line;
* Lead source code;
* Club code;
* Campaign year;
* Campaign number;
* Agent type; and
* Sales plan version.
