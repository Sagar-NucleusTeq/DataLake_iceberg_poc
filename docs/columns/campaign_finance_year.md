# Campaign Finance Year

Year of the marketing plan for this campaign. This is most important for C1. C1 is grouped with
the year it was budgeted even though it drops the year before. So C1 2021 is a part of the 2021
budget and will have a finance year of 2021 even though the campaign drops in late 2020 and thus
all the costs associated with it happen in 2020.
