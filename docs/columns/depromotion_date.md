# Depromotion Date

Occasionally an individual must be removed from a direct mail promotion. Since the audience to
mail is determined months before actual mail drop dates, several situations can necessitate this. 
One example is that the individual applies for a policy. If the individual purchases a term
product, they will no longer be eligible for standard direct mail term promotions. If they
were slated to receive one, they would have to be depromoted. If they apply for term and are
denied, then they will not receive term mailers in the future.

In theory, depromotion dates should always be before mail dates. However, in practice this isn't
true. While a business rule should be implemented to hedge against this, as of 3/16/2021 it is
technically allowed.
