# Requirement Sequence
This field is associated with the staging_lifeplus_lexis_nexis_scores model and is part of the grain
of that table. This sequence number is related to the underwriting requirements and the number gets
increased by one every time a user adds another requirement that already exists within the
requirements table (NBSUNWRQ) in Lifeplus.
