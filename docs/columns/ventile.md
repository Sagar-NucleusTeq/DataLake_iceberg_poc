# Ventile

Ventile is a grouping of 50 milles that range from 1-20. Ventile 1 = Mille 1- 50, Ventile 2 = 51-100, etc. until the 20th Ventile.
A ventile of 0 is used for a random tactic.  You can get a better understanding of what a mille is [here](#!/model/model.aaa_life_data_platform.gold_messages).
