# Attributed Date

The date that the policy was attributed to a response channel, a marketing driver, and
a marketing campaign/material. Attributed date these days will almost certainly be  
today since we have decided with the implementation of this new version of attribution  
on the data platform (compared to the previous method supported by Merkle on the MDE) to  
re-attribute all policies daily. We used to do everything we could when a policy came in  
and after attributing it we locked it in.
