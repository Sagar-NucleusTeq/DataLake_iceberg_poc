# Client Address Standardization Code
Indicator ('y','n') for whether the client address is allowed to be validated by USPS to be changed
to a standardized address format. By default in Lifeplus, all addresses are set to be validated,
but some are manually set to 'n' (no) because of the non-standard format of the actual address
is needed and is messed up when standardized by USPS.
