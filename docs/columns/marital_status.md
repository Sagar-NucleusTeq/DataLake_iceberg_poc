# Marital Status
The legally defined marital state of a client or party. There are several types of marital status:
single, married, widowed, divorced, separated and, in certain cases, registered partnership. 
Never married persons are persons who never got married in accordance with valid regulations.

For LifePlus the system recognizes 4 statuses in their documentation, but there are not data 
controls on the entry and the field therefore has many inputs that aren't governed or 
considered valid.
