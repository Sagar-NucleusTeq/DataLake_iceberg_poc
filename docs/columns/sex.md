# Sex At Time of Issue

This is the sex of the insured at the time of application as used in underwriting. This most closely aligns with 
biological sex, but there are differences depending on state regulations. For example, in some states all transgender
individuals are considered "unisex" for underwriting rather than their biological sex.
