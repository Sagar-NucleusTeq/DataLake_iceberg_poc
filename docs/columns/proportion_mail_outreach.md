# Proportion of mail messages out of total outreaches

Proportion of total messages a policy holder received that were mail messages.
If a policy holder was never sent a mail message,
this proportion will be zero. The column attempts a rough fractional attribution assuming
all marketing messages are equal in weight. It can be 
loosely interpreted as this proportion of the policy is attributable to the mail
marketing driver. However, until all marketing drivers are included in the attribution
algorithm, this number will be grossly inflated due to the fact that only mail and email
messages are considered. As such, it should be interpreted with extreme caution.
