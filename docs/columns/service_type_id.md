# Service Type ID

Ingested from United States Postal Service (USPS) Service Type Identifiers (STID) reference tables. The 
STID (Service Type Identifier) is a three-digit numeric code used within the Intelligent Mail® barcode
(IMb™) on a piece of mail that identifies the class of mail (e.g., first class, periodicals, etc.) as
well as any services requested by the sender.[1]

For further information please see the latest USPS reference tables:
