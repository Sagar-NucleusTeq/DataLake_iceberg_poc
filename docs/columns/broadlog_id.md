# Broadlog Identifier

The broadlog ID is the "unique" identifier of an entry in promotion_history and  
<a href="#!/model/model.data_platform.gold_messages" target="_blank">messages</a>.
This ID is generated by Adobe during the campaign selection process. As individual keys
are repeated and some campaigns have historically
experienced duplicated finder numbers, broadlog_id is the only way to tie back to a specific
record within promotion history.

As of 3/11/2021
all past duplicate broadlog ID issues have been resolved and this should be treated
as a unique identifier for the tables mentioned above.

# Attributed Broadlog ID

The broadlog ID is the "unique" identifier of an entry in
the consumption layer messages table/promtion_history.
As individual keys are repeated and some campaigns have historically
experienced duplicated finder numbers, broadlog id is the only way
to tie back to a specific record within these tables. Broadlog ID's
can still be duplicated if one record was depromoted but otherwise
should be unique. Edge case errors still exist.

The attributed broadlog id is the broadlog id of the record
in consumption layer messages table/promotion_history that the application was attributed to. This
entity is assigned during the attribution process using the
logic found here:
[Attribution Requirements](https://aaalife-data.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2PA/pages/5166366374/Attribution+2021+Requirements)

# Last Touch Attributed Broadlog ID

The broadlog ID is the "unique" identifier of an entry in
the consumption layer messages table/promotion_history.
As individual keys are repeated and some campaigns have historically
experienced duplicated finder numbers, broadlog id is the only way
to tie back to a specific record within these tables. Broadlog ID's
can still be duplicated if one record was depromoted but otherwise
should be unique. Edge case errors still exist.

The attributed broadlog id is the broadlog id of the record
in consumption layer messages table/promotion_history that the application was attributed to. This
record is defined during multi-touch attribution and is to be considered a true last touch.
It ignores lead source entirely and is only concerned with the last message the policy holder 
receives. Thus, if a policy has a Mail Response Channel (lead_source = 31) but receives an 
email closer to the application date, the last touch marketing driver would be email and the 
last touch broadlog id would correspond to that email message. This differs substantially from 
previous logic and will often differ from the last touch assigned in the V2 hierarchical
single-touch logic (algorithm found in mid_attribution schema and populates the 
mail_lead_source_attributed_broadlog_id column. See that column doc block for more information). 
The logic for this column is found in this confluence page:

# V2 Last Touch Attributed Broadlog ID

The broadlog ID is the "unique" identifier of an entry in
the consumption layer messages table/promotion_history.
As individual keys are repeated and some campaigns have historically
experienced duplicated finder numbers, broadlog id is the only way
to tie back to a specific record within these tables. Broadlog ID's
can still be duplicated if one record was depromoted but otherwise
should be unique. Edge case errors still exist.

The attributed broadlog id is the broadlog id of the record
in consumption layer messages table/promotion_history that the application was attributed to. This
record is defined during mail last-touch attribution and thus can differ from a true last touch setup. 
(The algorithm for this derivation is found in the mid_attribution schema.) To clarify, while we often
refer to the logic used to define this column as last-touch, it is more hierarchical. 
  - If an individual matches on finder number, that is the broadlog_id assigned, even if they received another mail packet
more recently. 
  - If an individual/household/address matches on phone number, that is the broadlog_id assigned, 
even if they were mailed another packet more recently. 
  - After these two levels, most recent mail is considered.

Additionally, the V2 logic only considers mail, SISU and Vanity URLs response channels (based off lead source) 
and mail message broadlog_ids for attribution. The column name attempts to describe this. Finally,
this column entity will often differ from the last_touch_attributed_broadlog_id in the same table, per
the logic above.
