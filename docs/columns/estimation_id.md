# Estimation Id

Estimation_id is the unique identifier from the model.dm_campaign_volume_estimations table, generated by the Campaign Estimator (https://gitlab.com/aaa-life/data-analytics-projects/insight_advisory/the-campaign-estimator-logic/-/tree/main) which consumes the volume plan and uses it to create an estimate for how a direct mail campaign might be executed.
