# Submitted Sales Production Adjustment
The purpose of this measure is to add an adjustment amount to the sales production to
ensure that agents are given the correct amount of sales production for converted policies.

This column is calculated based on the difference between the annualized 
premium and the submitted sales production. If the difference is negative then this measure would
be set to zero.
