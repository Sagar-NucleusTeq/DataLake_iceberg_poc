# Was the message depromoted?

True/False indicator of whether a message was depromoted (removed from the campaign).
Messages can be depromoted for a few reasons, there are some depromotions that happen  
at the printer because of address changes. ACE has the biggest depromotion rate  
because they receive the file before it goes to print and later select the individuals  
who are not to be mailed. There is a similar but smaller method with MWG.
