# Application Entry Date
Date that an application enters our policy administration system and is
automatically generated. As such, this date can be different from the 
[application signed date](#!/model/model.aaa_life_data_platform.staging_lifeplus_new_business_contracts#application_signed_date),
which can be backdated.
