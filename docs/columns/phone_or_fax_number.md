# Direct Mail Phone Number Called for Policy Application

The phone number an applicant calls to initiate the application process.
The entry is supposed to be automatic, but at times requires agent input
and is therefore prone to error. These phone numbers come from direct mail
packages which are now unique to campaign and are used to inform 
attribution. This column is pulled from policy information rather 
than the similarly named column in the creative package table.
