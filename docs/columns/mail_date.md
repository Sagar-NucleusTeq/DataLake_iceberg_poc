# Mail Date

Mail Date (for direct mail promotion records) is the touch start date 
of the direct mail campaign. Touch 
start date is defined as the first date that any communication was sent 
to potential customer as part of the touch.

As such, mail date must be equal to the touch start date in the campaign
touch table. (Not currently on the new platform so a test can not yet
be put in place.)

Mail dates for email campaigns will be NULL.
