# Paid Lead Source Indicator
A Boolean value that indicates whether a lead source code is driven by payment to a third party vendor.  For instance, 
*Paid Search* is considered a paid source because we need to pay Google, Microsoft, or some other search vendor.  
Conversely, *Email*, despite requiring internal resources to create and administer, is not considered a paid lead 
source.
