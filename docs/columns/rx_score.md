# LifePlus RX Score (Prescription Mortality Score)
For prescription history scores, the bigger the score the worse the risk (it's essentially a 
mortality scalar - at least in the middle of the bell curve it is) scores are between 0 & 10. This
relationship is in opposition to Lexis Nexis scores (also mortality scores based on a composite
of things) those scores are measured in hundreds and the higher the score the better the risk from
AAA Life's point of view.
