# Modal Premium
How much premium is due at the time of each bill date. This is connected with billing mode, if a policy changes their 
frequency of payment the modal premium will change, you can pay many small increments of premium or one big lump sum in a year.

This is a choice, it can often be chosen at the time of issue (but not always, GIWL Online is defaulted to 
monthly credit card payments only) and can edit the choice over time if the policy holder chooses.

Regarding billing and policy fees: the modal premium from Lifeplus on the contract tables include any fees associated with the contract.
The modal premium, as found on the benefit tables in LifePlus, does not include fees as fees are applied at the contract level.
For policies sourced from the FAST policy administration system, fees are included in the model premium provided to us, we
do not to date have the ability to see the policy fees separate from the benefits, as the billing structures in that system are different.
