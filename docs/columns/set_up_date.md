# Set Up Date
A claim is considered as 'set up' when it is entered into the CAP system and is assigned a claim 
number. For claims that are manually set up, the reported date will serve as the set up date. 

Notes:

Waivers are never set up, i.e. assigned a claim id, because it is not a 'death'. They are only 
reported and stay in that status.
